Jump or Duck: A TikTok Interactive Game
This is a single-file web application designed for live, interactive gameplay. It's an endless runner where viewers can vote to control the player.
How to Play
The player (streamer) controls a character that moves automatically.
• Viewer Interaction: Viewers can send commands by clicking the "Jump!" or "Duck!" buttons, as well as the new "Speed!" and "Slow!" buttons.
• Gameplay: The game processes the most recent command and applies it to the character, causing it to jump over or slide under upcoming obstacles.
• Jump or Duck: The character must jump over low obstacles and duck under high ones.
• Speed & Slow: The character can collect speed boost power-ups to temporarily move faster, or get caught in a slow-down trap that hinders their movement.
Features
• Simple Gameplay: Easy to understand and highly engaging for a live audience.
• Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for mobile, which is essential for TikTok.
• Real-time Feedback: The game displays the most recent command and its effect.
This application is a proof-of-concept. It can be easily expanded with more complex obstacles, power-ups, and a scoring system.
